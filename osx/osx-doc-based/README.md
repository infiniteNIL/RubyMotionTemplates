osx-doc-based
=============

RubyMotion template for an OS X document-based application with NIB files.

Produces the same thing as Xcode's Cocoa Application project template for a document-based application without Core Data.

In addition, it's already setup for Cocoapods, Bundler, and uses the IB gem, and it automatically puts the app name in all the appropriate menu items.

## Installation

Just place the whole osx-doc-based folder in ~/Libary/RubyMotion/templates

## Usage

	motion create --template=osx-doc-based app-name
